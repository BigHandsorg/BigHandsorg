- 👋 Hi, I’m @BigHandsorg, I actually chose my username based off of my massage website, I was just so excited to be buying the domain as I was making my GitHub profile.
- 👀 Interested in Data & Ai, I love playing games, but I don't see myself making them. I'd much rather understand a company's data so I know if its stock is a good buy.
- 🌱 Currently learning C++. I was really looking forward to learning Python, but the college seems to prioritize C++, which I hear can be used for AI development, which I find interesting as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn from others.
